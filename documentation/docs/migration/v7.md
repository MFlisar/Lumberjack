!!! info

    Version `7.*` is a kotlin multiplatform rewrite, that's why some fundamantal changes needed to be done!

Some things have become extension functions to provide target specific implementations and overloads:

* `FileLoggerSetup.<Daily/...>.create` => new import because it is an extension function now:`import com.michaelflisar.lumberjack.loggers.file.create`
* `getAllExistingLogFiles` => new import because it is an extension function now: `import com.michaelflisar.lumberjack.core.getAllExistingLogFiles`
* `Level.priority` => new import because it is an extension function now: `import com.michaelflisar.lumberjack.core.classes.priority`

I did also fix a typo, namely following:

* `getLatestLogFiles` => `getLatestLogFile` (also become an extension function btw)
