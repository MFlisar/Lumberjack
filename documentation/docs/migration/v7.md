!!! info

    Version `7.*` is a kotlin multiplatform rewrite, that's why some fundamantal changes needed to be done!

Some things have become extension functions to provide target specific implementations and overloads:

#### Logger setup classes

I do provide platform specific `create` function to make single platform usage easier. On android those do look like following now:

```kotlin
val setup = FileLoggerSetup.Daily.create(context, fileBaseName = "log_daily")
val setup2 = FileLoggerSetup.FileSize.create(context, maxFileSizeInBytes = 1000 * 10 /* 10 kB */,  fileBaseName = "log_size", filesToKeep = 2)
```

In MP projects you can simply use the classes themself if you want to.

#### Functions become extension functions

To provide platform specific implementations, some functions needed to be converted to extension functions:

* `getAllExistingLogFiles`
  new import: `import com.michaelflisar.lumberjack.core.getAllExistingLogFiles`
* `Level.priority`
  new import: `import com.michaelflisar.lumberjack.core.classes.priority`
* `getLatestLogFiles` => `getLatestLogFile` (also fixed a typo)
